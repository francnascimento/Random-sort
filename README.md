# Random-sort
This is the best way I've found to sort an array in a crescent order. 
Also, as long as im aware, it's the fastest algorithm ever created to sort an array.

"But Gabriel! I've just runned your program and it takes like 2 minutes to sort a 12 sized array!!"
Well then I guess you should change your computer.
