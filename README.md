# Random sort
This is the best way I've found to sort an array in a crescent order. 
Also, as long as im aware, it's the fastest algorithm ever created to sort an array.

"But Gabriel! I've just runned your program and it takes like 2 minutes to sort a 12 sized array!!"
Well then I guess you should change your computer!

But seriously now. This is just part of the silly stuff I like to do when I'm bored. And I actually think its kind of fun. And I use to properly use Git.
